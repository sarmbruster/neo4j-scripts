= neo4j-scripts

This repository contains some unsorted scripts in conjunction with http://neo4j.com[Neo4j]

Most of the scripts here require a local installation of http://www.groovy-lang.org[groovy].

WARNING: Some scripts make use of http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html[Grape], so they will download jar files from maven repositories when started for the very first time. Download will take some time. Subsequent invocations will be much faster.
